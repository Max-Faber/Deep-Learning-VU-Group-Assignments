    "#### Instructions on how to use this notebook:\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook is hosted on Google Colab. To be able to work on it, you have to create your own copy. Go to *File* and select *Save a copy in Drive*.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can also avoid using Colab entirely, and download the notebook to run it on your own machine. If you choose this, go to *File* and select *Download .ipynb*.\n",
    "\n",
    "The advantage of using Colab is that you can use a GPU. You can complete this assignment with a CPU, but it will take a bit longer. Furthermore, we encourage you to train using the GPU not only for faster training, but also to get experience with this setting. This includes moving models and tensors to the GPU and back. This experience is very valuable because for many interesting models and large datasets (like large CNNs for ImageNet, or Transformer models trained on Wikipedia), training on GPU is the only feasible way.\n",
    "\n",
    "The default Colab runtime does not have a GPU. To change this, go to *Runtime - Change runtime type*, and select *GPU* as the hardware accelerator. The GPU that you get changes according to what resources are available at the time, and its memory can go from a 5GB, to around 18GB if you are lucky. If you are curious, you can run the following in a code cell to check:\n",
    "\n",
    "```sh\n",
    "!nvidia-smi\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that despite the name, Google Colab does  not support collaborative work without issues. When two or more people edit the notebook concurrently, only one version will be saved. You can choose to do group programming with one person sharing the screen with the others, or make multiple copies of the notebook to work concurrently.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Submission:** Upload your notebook in .ipynb format to Canvas. The code and answers to the questions in the notebook are sufficient, no separate report is expected. "

This interest has been spurred by the introduction of Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs).\n",

At each step, use your function from Question 13 to append the adjacency matrix to `adj_matrices`, append the matrix of input features to `feature_matrices`, create the array of batch indices (as explained above) and append it to `batch_indices`, and append the label of the graph to `labels`. **Make sure to convert the label to float**.\n",
    "- Once the loop is over, use `scipy.sparse.block_diag()` to build the block diagonal matrix $\\hat{A}_B$. Convert it to the COO format, and then use your answer to Question 6 to turn it into a sparse PyTorch tensor.\n",
    "- Use `torch.cat()` to concatenate the tensors in `feature_matrices` along the first dimension. Do this also for `batch_indices` and `labels`.\n",
    "- Return the 4 tensors computed in the previous two items."
